I am a PhD student at the University of Michigan School of Information. I'm interested in utilizing technologies to improve health and care for all, with specific focus on marginalized communities. Guided by health justice as a grounding framework, my research explores designing health informatics technologies that shift power dynamics and reallocate resources to serve the needs of diverse communities.

My research is informed by science and technology studies, which inspires to view technology and healthcare as systems that have great power over the individuals they intend to serve, resulting in differential effects on different populations. I also have a soft spot for evidence-based research that addresses health inequities. My research interest in health-related inequities ground my work in upstream and community-level mechanisms. I draw strength from my previous experience conducting community-based participatory research in China, where I worked with sexual and gender minority communities to design technology-mediated care for preventive health outcomes. I believe that we can use decentralized and participatory approaches to health technology design for a a more democratic health ecosystem and a more just health future for all.
